# AI/ML-Based Solar Power Generation Prediction ðŸŒž

A **Solar Power Prediction Platform** leveraging AI/ML to provide accurate, site-specific solar power output predictions based on environmental and physical parameters.

---

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement
Solar energy is a promising renewable source, but actual power generation depends on multiple dynamic factors such as location, sunlight, panel orientation, shading, and weather. Traditional estimation methods often fail to capture real-world variations, leading to overestimation or underutilization.

This platform predicts solar power output, suggests optimal panel placement, and provides actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.

## ðŸ›  Implementation
1. **Data Sourcing**
   - Historical solar data from **NASA API** for training the model.
   - User inputs: latitude, longitude, panel surface area, tilt & azimuth angles.
   - Current weather data fetched via **OpenWeather API** (temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover).

2. **Solar Power Calculation**
   - Used **PVlib** library to calculate:
     - **DHI, GHI, DNI** (irradiance components)
     - **Hourly kWh generation**
   - Generated predictions for:
     - Daily power generation
     - Hourly generation for selected date
     - 5-day forecast bar charts

3. **Optimal Configuration & Insights**
   - Compares current vs. **optimal tilt & azimuth angles**
   - Shows improvement as a **percentage gain**
   - Provides actionable recommendations for panel placement

4. **Frontend/UI Features**
   - **Interactive Dashboard** for input and visualization
   - Graphs:
     - Hourly kWh generation
     - 5-Days output
     - Current vs Optimal configuration
   - **Automatic location fetching** using **Jio API** for autocomplete and reverse geocoding
   - **Multi-lingual support**
   - **Chatbot assistance** for help

5. **Reporting**
   - Export predicted data as **CSV or PDF**
   - Reports include daily, weekly, monthly generation and optimization suggestions
